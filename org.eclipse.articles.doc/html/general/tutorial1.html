<p class="summary">The Rich Client Platform (RCP) is an exciting new way to
build Java applications that can compete with native applications on any
platform. This tutorial is designed to get you started building RCP applications
quickly.</p>
<p><b>By Ed Burnette, SAS</b><br>

<hr width="100%">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Try this experiment: Show Eclipse to some friends or co-workers who haven't
seen it before and ask them to guess what language it is written in. Chances
are, they'll guess VB, C++, or C#, because those languages are used most often
for high quality client side applications. Then watch the look on their faces
when you tell them it was created in Java, especially if they are Java
programmers.</p>
<p>Because of its unique open source license, you can use the technologies that
went into Eclipse to create your own commercial quality programs With previous
version of Eclipse, this was possible but difficult, especially when you wanted
to heavily customize the menus, layouts, and other user interface elements. That
was because the "IDE-ness" of Eclipse was hard-wired into it. Version
3 introduces the Rich Client Platform, which is basically a refactoring of the
fundamental parts of Eclipse's UI, allowing it to be used for non-IDE
applications.</p>
<p>If you want to cut to the chase and look at the code for this part
you can use Eclipse's built-in 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/cvshowto.html">CVS client</a>
to download the 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1">source code</a>
to your workspace.
Otherwise, let's take a look at how to construct
an RCP application.</p>

<h2><a name="section_1"></a> Getting started</h2>
<p>RCP applications are based on the familiar Eclipse plug-in architecture, (if
it's not familiar to you, see the references section). Therefore, you'll need to
create a plug-in to be your main program.
Select New &gt; Project &gt; Plug-in
Development &gt; Plug-in Project to bring up the Plug-in Project wizard. On the
subsequent pages, enter a Project name such as <b>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1</b>,
indicate you want a Java project, and
enter a Plug-in Id (this should match the project name).
</p>
<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/note.gif" alt="Note: " height="13" width="62">
Don't select the Alternate Format option that says
Create an OSGi bundle manifest for the plug-in.
See the section on Compatibility and migration for more details.
</p>

<p>
The generated plug-in class that you may be familiar with in previous
releases is no longer required in Eclipse 3.0.
You can still have one to hold global data if you like, but for this
example just remove it altogether to save a little space.
To do this, turn off the option that says
Generate the Java class that controls the plug-ins life cycle.
Then Click on Finish to
generate the template.
If you get a dialog asking if Eclipse can switch to the Plug-in Development
Perspective click Yes (this is optional).</p>

<h2>Plug-in manifest</h2>
<p>The plug-in manifest, plugin.xml, ties all the code and resources together.
When you first create a plug-in, Eclipse will edit the manifest for you
automatically.
You need to define the class name of the main program
with the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension
and the perspective with <code>org.eclipse.ui.perspectives</code>.
To add these extensions use the Add button on the Extensions tab,
or just type in the XML in the plugin.xml tab.
Also, you need to tell Eclipse that the plug-in will depend on two other Eclipse plugins,
<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code> and
<code>org.eclipse.ui</code>, so those need to be added to the
Dependencies tab or in the XML.
While you're editing it you can change the version number,
provider name, and other options to your liking.
When you're done your plugin.xml should look something like listing 1.
The classes refered to here will be defined in the next section
and the tags starting with percents (%) will be defined later in plugin.properties.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 1. plugin.xml
</b></p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;?eclipse version="3.0"?&gt;
&lt;plugin
    id="org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1"
    name="%pluginName"
    version="0.0.0"
    provider-name="%providerName"&gt;

    &lt;runtime&gt;
        &lt;library name="part1.jar"&gt;
            &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
        &lt;/library&gt;
    &lt;/runtime&gt;
    &lt;requires&gt;
        &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.core.runtime"/&gt;
        &lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.ui"/&gt;
    &lt;/requires&gt;


    &lt;extension
        id="RcpApplication"
        point="org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications"&gt;
        &lt;application&gt;
            &lt;run
                class="org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication"&gt;
            &lt;/run&gt;
        &lt;/application&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension
        point="org.eclipse.ui.perspectives"&gt;
        &lt;perspective
            name="%perspectiveName"
            class="org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective"
            id="org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective"&gt;
        &lt;/perspective&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/note.gif" alt="Note: " height="13" width="62">
Although it's not an absolute requirement,
I recommend keeping your id's and your class names the same.
For example, <code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</code>
is both the fully qualified id for the application and the class name of the
main program.
For historical reasons, Eclipse prepends the plug-in's id to the id of your
top level plug-in elements (like <code>extension</code>) so even though
plugin.xml says <code>id="RcpApplication"</code> the fully qualified id
for that extension is <code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</code>.
Since the perspective's id is written on a sub-element
(<code>perspective</code>) it has to be spelled out completely
in the manifest
(<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective</code>).
</p>

<h2>The main program</h2>
<p>
The <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension tells
the Eclipse runtime the name of your main program.
Create a new Java class with that name,
make it implement <code>IPlatformRunnable</code>,
and put your program code in the <code>run()</code> method.
Listing 2 shows a simple implementation with the minimum you have to do.
The <code>RcpWorkbenchAdvisor</code> class will be defined shortly.
</p>
<p><b>Listing 2. RcpApplication class
</b></p>
<pre>package org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1;

import org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPlatformRunnable;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display;
import org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI;
import org.eclipse.ui.application.WorkbenchAdvisor;

public class RcpApplication implements IPlatformRunnable {

    public Object run(Object args) {
        WorkbenchAdvisor workbenchAdvisor = new RcpWorkbenchAdvisor();
        Display display = PlatformUI.createDisplay();
        try {
            int returnCode = PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(display,
                    workbenchAdvisor);
            if (returnCode == PlatformUI.RETURN_RESTART) {
                return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_RESTART;
            } else {
                return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_OK;
            }
        } finally {
            display.dispose();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Creating a default perspective</h2>
<p>
Next, you must define at least one perspective and make it the default.
Perspectives are created by implementing <code>IPerspectiveFactory</code>
using the class name referred to by the <code>org.eclipse.ui.perspectives</code> extension
(see listing 3).
The important part
of this interface is the <code>createInitialLayout()</code> method where you position and
open any views and/or editors you'd like the user to start with.
In this example
we're not going to create any views so it will be a pretty boring perspective.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 3. RcpPerspective class
</b></p>
<pre>package org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1;

import org.eclipse.ui.IPageLayout;
import org.eclipse.ui.IPerspectiveFactory;

public class RcpPerspective implements IPerspectiveFactory {

    public RcpPerspective() {
    }

    public void createInitialLayout(IPageLayout layout) {
    }
}

</pre>

<h2>Workbench Advisor</h2>
<p>
The Workbench Advisor class,
which you referred to in the main program,
helps customize the workbench to add and subtract
toolbars, perspectives, and so forth.
This will covered in more detail in part 2 of the tutorial.
For now, the absolute minimum you have to do here
is define which perspective is the default one.
See listing 4 for the code.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 4. RcpWorkbenchAdvisor class
</b></p>
<pre>package org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1;
import org.eclipse.ui.application.WorkbenchAdvisor;

public class RcpWorkbenchAdvisor extends WorkbenchAdvisor {

    public String getInitialWindowPerspectiveId() {
        return "org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective";
    }
}
</pre>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The build.properties file (see listing 5)
will be needed when exporting the application for
others to use.</p>

<p><b>Listing 5. build.properties
</b></p>
<pre>bin.includes = plugin.xml,\
               *.jar,\
               part1.jar,\
               plugin.properties
source.part1.jar = src/
</pre>

<p>
Finally, you need to create a plugin.properties file (listing 6) for any natural language strings at the
plug-in registry level (i.e., things the run-time has to know about your plug-in
before even loading it).
You could hard-code these into your plug-in manifest
but it's best to get into the i18n habit from the start.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 6. plugin.properties
</b></p>
<pre>pluginName = RcpTutorial1 Plug-in
providerName = Eclipse.org
perspectiveName = RcpTutorial1
</pre>

<h2>Taking it for a spin</h2>
<p>To test and debug this plug-in, select Run &gt;
Debug..., select Run-time Workbench,
then click New to create a new configuration.
In the Arguments tab, select
<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</code>
for the name of the application to run.
This comes from the id specified on the
<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension point
(in this example, <code>RcpApplication</code>), prepended with the
plug-in id (<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1</code>).
</p>
<p>Now switch over to the Plug-ins tab.
Select the option to
Choose plug-ins and fragments to launch from the list.
We want the smallest possible set of plug-ins involved
in your program so click on Deselect All,
scroll down and place a checkmark next to your plug-in
(<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1</code>),
and click Add Required Plug-ins.
Then click on Debug and
you should see a bare-bones Workbench start up (see figure 1).
Your window will probably be bigger than this; we'll see in
part 2 of the tutorial how to control that.
</p>

<p><b>Figure 1. World's simplest RCP application.
</b></p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/spin.png">

<p>If you don't see this, you should be able to find an error message in the
run-time workbench's log file.
This file is in different places for different releases but
as of this writing can be found in <code>./configuration/nnnnn.log</code>
where <i>nnnnn</i> is a long random number. Simply bring
it up in a text editor and look for the most recent errors. You may find it
useful to delete the log files before running the program so you won't get
confused by older messages.</p>
<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/tip.gif" alt="Tip: " height="13" width="62">
Specify the <code>-consoleLog</code> option
in the Arguments tab under Program Arguments (in the launch configuration)
to have all error messages sent to the Console.
This is easier than searching around for the log file.
</p>

<h2>Running it outside of Eclipse</h2>
<p>The whole point of all this is to be able to run stand-alone applications
without the user having to know anything about the Java and Eclipse code being
used under the covers. For a real application you will probably want to provide
a self-contained executable generated by an install program like InstallShield.
That's really beyond the scope of this article though, so we'll do something
simpler.</p>
<p>We need to create a simplified version of the Eclipse install directory
because the Eclipse plug-in loader expects things to be in a certain layout.
Here are the steps to get started:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right click on the plug-in project and select Export.
  </li><li>Select Deployable plug-ins and fragments and then press Next.
  </li><li>Select the plug-in(s) that should be included. For this
  example that would be org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.
  </li><li>Select the option to deploy as a directory structure, and for the
  directory enter a name ending with RcpTutorial1 (for example, C:\RcpTutorial1 on
  Windows).
  </li><li>If you want to provide source code for your application,
  select the Include source code option.
  </li><li>Press Finish to export the plug-in.
  Eclipse will perform a full build in the background
  and populate the directory for you.
</li></ol>
<p>To complete the RcpTutorial1 directory, copy the startup.jar file from the Eclipse
install directory into the top level, and copy all the org.eclipse plug-ins
that are required into the plugins directory.
</p>
<p>
Which plug-ins are required, you ask?
Earlier, when you created a launch configuration to debug
the RCP application you clicked on
the Add Required Plug-ins button.
Simply open the launch configuration again to see the list.
Copy all the plug-ins that are checked off there.
In addition, you need to copy the
<code>org.eclipse.update.configurator</code>
plug-in if you want automatic discovery of plug-ins at runtime
(which we do).
</p>
<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/note.gif" alt="Note: " height="13" width="62">
Unfortunately, as of this writing there is no automatic way to do this
so you need to do the copies by hand.
This process is error prone and a never-ending source of
frustration to RCP developers.
See the troubleshooting section for some helpful advice.
Hopefully a future version of Eclipse will provide
better support for this.
</p>
<p>
When you're
done you should have a structure that looks like this:</p>
<pre>    RcpTutorial1
    |    startup.jar
    +--- plugins
         +--- org.eclipse.core.expressions_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.help_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.jface_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.osgi_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.swt.win32_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.swt_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1_0.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.ui.workbench_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.ui_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.update.configurator_3.0.0
</pre>
<p>That's all you need to run an RCP application, but it would be difficult for
anyone to use it without some kind of launching program. Eclipse uses
eclipse.exe, but for this example we'll just use a batch file.
On Windows, create a command file
called rcptutorial1.cmd and place it in the top level RcpTutorial1 directory.
</p>
<pre>   echo on
   setlocal
   cd %~dp0
   start javaw -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
      -application org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication %*
   endlocal
</pre>
<p>The start command should be all on one line. As before, the -application
option refers back to the id specified on the
<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications extension point.</code></p>

<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/tip.gif" alt="Tip: " height="13" width="62">
Specify the <code>-clean</code> option
on the command line to cause the core runtime to discard its caches
and re-read all the plug-in manifests.
Normally, Eclipse caches manifest information to speed startup,
but if you are adding and removing plug-ins or changing configuration
options the cache may get out of sync.
Remove <code>-clean</code> for best performance in production applications.
</p>

<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/note.gif" alt="Note: " height="13" width="62">
The Linux shell version is similar, but for some reason you have to add
a few extra options to identify the operating and window system.
I can't verify this because I don't have a Linux system but this command
line is reported to work:
</p>
<pre>   java -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
      -application org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication
      -os linux -ws gtk -arch x86 -nl en_US $*
</pre>

<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/note.gif" alt="Note: " height="13" width="62">
To run it under Mac OS, you must use the java_swt executable that comes
with the Eclipse SDK instead of the regular java executable that comes with
the Java SDK.
</p>

<p>You can get as fancy as you want in this script file. Here's a variant that I
like to use when debugging because it will display any error messages from the
Eclipse loader in a separate window.
This is for Windows; the Linux version would be similar.</p>
<pre>   echo on
   setlocal
   cd %~dp0
   java -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
      -application org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication
      -consoleLog %* || pause
   endlocal
</pre>
<p>The java command should be all on one line.</p>
<p>To eliminate the startup window on Windows, you can use a shortcut instead of
a script file. Right click inside the RcpTutorial1 folder, select New &gt; Shortcut
and enter this as the location of the item (on one line):</p>
<pre>    %windir%\system32\javaw.exe -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
        -application org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication
</pre>
<p>
Enter a descriptive name on the next page and then press Finish. Then try
double-clicking on your new shortcut to try it out. You may want to edit the
shortcut (right click on it and select Properties) to change the default working
directory.
All these files can be found in the
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1">example project</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="tutorial1_files/note.gif" alt="Note: " height="13" width="62">
For fully branding a program with a splash screen, custom icons, and so forth
you'll need to set up some configuration files and use
the eclipse.exe launcher.
See the online help under Platform Plug-in Developer Guide &gt;
Programmer's Guide &gt; Packaging and delivering Eclipse based products
for more information.
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
After I wrote this tutorial I started getting mail from people who couldn't
run it for one reason or another.
This section will collect the errors that they've seen and
the solutions.
Remember to use the <code>-consoleLog</code> command line option to see
extra diagnostics in the console window where you invoked your
RCP application,
and <code>-clean</code> to purge the core runtime's cache of any stale
information when changing plug-ins and configurations.
</p>
<dl>

<dt>
<b>Launching failed because the following plug-ins are neither in the
workspace nor selected on the Target Platform preference page: ...</b>
</dt><dd>
This one is a sanity check performed by PDE.
It's pretty self explanitory so just look at the list
provided, go to the Plug-ins tab of your launch configuration,
and put a checkmark next to all of the plug-ins listed
in the error.

</dd><dt>
<b>!MESSAGE Unable to locate application extension: org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</b>
</dt><dd>
First, check to make sure that the plug-in containing your
application is included in your launch configuration.
Next, check the spelling, and remember that the application name
is the plug-in id followed by a period and the id you specified on the
<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension.
This message might also be printed if all the required
plug-ins are not available at run-time.
Check the log for additional error messages that may identify the
specific plug-ins that are missing.

</dd><dt>
<b>!MESSAGE Bundle update@/c:/RcpTutorial1/plugins/org.eclipse.ui_3.0.0/ [13] was not resolved.</b>
</dt><dd>
This one is a little tougher.
It usually means that some prerequisite of the plug-in listed was not there.
Usually the log will contain additional messages that will tell you
which plug-ins were missing.
You can also find out exactly what's going on by re-running the program
with the <code>-console</code> command line option.
This will allow you to enter OSGi console commands to diagnose the problem.
After the error occurs again, go to the console window and enter the
<code>ss</code> command.
You'll see one or more plug-ins (bundles) which were installed but not resolved.
Pick one of them (in the above message it would be number 13), and enter the
<code>diag <i>nnn</i></code> command, where <i>nnn</i>
is the bundle number. For example, "<b>diag 13</b>".
This will tell you what the missing bundle is.
Note that you can't run OSGi commands if the program has already terminated.

</dd><dt>
<b>'1.4' target mode requires '-1.4' compliance mode: 1.3</b>
</dt><dd>
This is one of the more annoying PDE build errors, especially since you have to go hunt
in a zip file for it.
To correct it, go to Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Compiler
&gt; Compliance and Classfiles.
Adjust the compliance levels as follows:<br>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td>Compiler compliance level: </td><td>1.4
</td></tr><tr><td>Use default compliance settings: </td><td>off
</td></tr><tr><td>Generated .class files compatibility: </td><td>1.4
</td></tr><tr><td>Source compatibility: </td><td>1.4
</td></tr><tr><td>Disallow identifiers called 'assert': </td><td>Error
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</dd><dt>
<b>
java.lang.RuntimeException: Application
"org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication" could not be found
in the registry. The applications available are:
&lt;NONE&gt;.
</b>
</dt><dd>
This is caused by a missing plug-in, most commonly
<code>org.eclipse.update.configurator</code>.
The update configurator is responsible for scanning the plugins directory to
discover what plug-ins are available.
Without it, you have to list them out manually in a configuration file
(config.ini).
Unfortunately this plug-in is not part of the standard
RCP SDK, so you have to copy it from the regular Eclipse SDK.

</dd><dt>
<b>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Control</b>
<br>(a number of different SWT classes may be mentioned in the error)
</dt><dd>
When running an RCP application under Linux GTK you need specify command
line options that identify your operating and windowing system, for example,
<code>-os linux -ws gtk</code>.
When running under Mac OS, you need to use the java_swt program that came with
the Eclipse SDK instead of the normal java program.

</dd></dl>


<h2>Compatibility and migration</h2>
<p>
Astute readers will notice a new 3.0 version comment in plugin.xml
and a few references in Eclipse
wizards and documentation to OSGi and an optional manifest file
called MANIFEST.MF.
What's all that about?
For the most part this is transparent and RCP
developers don't have to worry about it.
But just in case, let's take a few moments to discuss these changes
from Eclipse 2.1.
</p>
<p>
The 3.0 tag in plugin.xml
(<code>&lt;?eclipse version="3.0"?&gt;</code>)
says whether or not the plugin.xml itself is in 3.0 form.
For Eclipse 3.0 there were various changes to the plugins
(code moved, new plugins, etc.) and various extension points moved.
The presence of the 3.0 tag tells the runtime that it does not
need to do any "munging" of the plugin.xml to map the old
form/names onto the new form/names. 
</p>
<p>
If you need to convert a version 2.1 plug-in to 3.0, we suggest you
use the PDE 3.0 migration wizard instead of doing it manually.
To run it from the Package Explorer, right click on plugin.xml
and select PDE Tools &gt; Migrate to 3.0.
After you do this the plug-in will not function in earlier
versions of Eclipse.
The tool does all the munging to use a compatibility layer
(<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility</code>),
updates your classpaths, and so forth.
Later you can consult the Eclipse 3.0 Plug-in Migration Guide
(see the references or online help)
for assistance in converting any deprecated API calls.
After all the old calls have been removed you can replace
the compatibility layer with the regular runtime code
(<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>).
</p>
<p>
Finally, Eclipse 3.0  introduced a new run-time system based on OSGi standards that
uses bundles and a new manifest file (MANIFEST.MF) to implement plug-ins.
The use of MANIFEST.MF, in normal circumstances, is completely optional.
You will notice that almost all of the 3.0 SDK plug-ins do NOT have one
yet all are marked as 3.0 and many do not require the compatibility layer.
The only reason you would want to have a MANIFEST.MF is if you need to
