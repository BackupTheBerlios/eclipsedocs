<h1 align="center">How To Keep Up To Date</h1>
<blockquote><b>Summary</b><br>This article shows you how to create and publish 
  bundles of plug-ins (called features) to an update site so that customers can 
  download and install them directly into Eclipse using the Eclipse update 
  manager. This has many advantages over the low tech way of delivering new or 
  updated plug-ins in a zip file that someone manually unzips into the directory 
  where Eclipse is installed.

<h2>Staying up to date</h2>
<p>More often than not, software products are out of date as soon as they appear 
on the market: new features and bug fixes are already available before the CD's 
hit the shelves and web sites provide links for downloading. Eclipse based 
products are no different. Over the course of a project, remember how many times 
you exchanged plug-ins using email attachments with the suggestion 'just unzip 
into the Eclipse directory'. Of course, it works. But would you sell a product 
with 500 plug-ins for $2999, then send updates to customers by email with 
similar instructions? Or post hundreds of zip files on a web site, along with 
installation instructions ?</p>
<p>In the real world where commercial products are built on top of Eclipse 
technology, new plug-ins and updates to existing ones must be delivered in a 
more convenient way. Another consequence of charging people for software is that 
there are legal ramifications to reckon with. For this reason, Eclipse platform 
has a component that deals with installing and updating plug-ins that is both 
convenient and keeps your company's lawyers happy. </p>
<h3>Plug-ins are too small (even the large ones)</h3>
<p>We already know that the basic building block of Eclipse functionality is a 
plug-in. Its manifest contains all the information required by Eclipse to 
successfully load it, contribute into the application and run. However, it is 
not particularly well suited for distribution. One reason is that a plug-in is 
functionally too fine-grained. We always start small, but real production 
quality plug-ins rarely come alone. A more realistic situation is to have 
several plug-ins working together to perform a useful function. Example: Java 
Tools consists of 9 plug-ins, PDE has 5 etc. These plug-ins require each other 
and go together - their usefulness is limited in isolation.</p>
<p>To represent a unit of useful functionality Eclipse has a notion of 
<b>features</b>. Instead of saying 'take these 9 plug-ins that go together', you 
should be able to say 'take Java Tools'. </p>
<p>The role of features is to allow providers to make collections of plug-ins 
that logically go together. These collections are made in such a way as to 
provide for easy transport over the network, have necessary legal and security 
mechanisms, and are modular to allow hierarchical product building.</p>
<p>Features are designed to help in performing the three major tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b><a name="task1"></a>Install new functionality into Eclipse products</b>. 
  This task allows you to add things you didn't have before and make your 
  product do more. 
  </li><li><b>Update the plug-ins you already have to the newer versions</b>. This 
  task allows you to receive fixes and upgrades to the functionality you already 
  have. Official fix packs and emergency fixes for the pesky bugs that make your 
  life miserable all fall into this category. 
  </li><li><b>Control which plug-ins should run when Eclipse starts</b>. This task 
  allows you to disable an entire group of plug-ins, thus making them invisible 
  to Eclipse run-time (note that they are still physically present in the 
  product). This comes in handy in large products where you have the whole slew 
  of features you don't care about at the moment and want to get rid of the user 
  interface artifacts you never use. </li></ol>
<p>Although features group plug-ins together, they are not containers. All the 
plug-ins are installed in the 'plugins' directory in the Eclipse product 
location. Features simply reference plug-ins (and fragments) that belong to 
them. This important property plays a major role in optimizing performance when 
downloading over the network. It allows Eclipse to download only the plug-ins 
that have actually changed between the two feature versions. It is easy to 
imagine why downloading 20 new plug-ins out of 500 makes a huge difference in 
this scenario.</p>
<h3>What's in the manifest?</h3>
<p>As plug-ins have <b>plug-in manifests</b>, features have <b>feature 
manifests</b>. The file name is feature.xml and it can contain the following 
things (the full DTD can be found in the reference section of the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/help21/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/feature_archive.html">Eclipse 
platform documentation</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature id, version, provider name, image to use in Eclipse 
  </li><li>Short description, URL to long description, license agreement, copyright 
  statement 
  </li><li>References to other features (for building complex feature trees by 
  inclusion) 
  </li><li>Dependencies (features can require presence of other plug-ins or features 
  as a prerequisite for installation) 
  </li><li>List of plug-ins and fragments that belong to the feature 
  </li><li>List of data archives that belong to the feature (normally go together 
  with the custom install handler) </li></ul>
<p>This list is not complete but is fairly representative. A manifest file can 
contain translatable content but it is better to place it in 
feature_&lt;NL&gt;.properties files that will be picked as Java resource bundles 
based on the current locale. This is analogous to the way NL content is handled 
for plug-ins.</p>
<h3>Where features live</h3>
<p>Features exist in two major places and incarnations: <b>installed</b> (in the 
Eclipse product) and <b>packaged</b> (on the server as part of the update 
site).</p>
<p>Imagine for a second that Eclipse is completely empty i.e. has no plug-ins 
and features. To get any functionality into it, you would need to download 
features from the server (see <a href="http://eclipse.org/articles/Article-Update/keeping-up-to-date.html#task1">task 
#1</a> above). For this to happen, features must be published on a HTTP server 
in the following way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All features must be packaged into the JAR archives (one per feature) and 
  placed into the directory called 'features' 
  </li><li>All plug-ins must be packaged into the JAR archives (one per plug-in) and 
  placed into the directory called 'plugins' 
  </li><li>An update site map (an XML file with the name 'site.xml') should be placed 
  in the root of the update site (the folder that contains 'features' and 
  'plugins') </li></ul>
<p>Features and plug-ins are packaged into archives for easy transportation over 
the network. In addition, archives can be digitally signed. If you are charging 
for your software and want to protect your customers as they download updates 
from your site, it is a good idea to sign your archives using valid 
certificates. If not, Eclipse Update will warn your users that they are about to 
install an unsigned feature (a scary message indeed).</p>
<p><img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tip.gif" height="13" width="62"> Security issues with 
features should not be underestimated. Eclipse allows users to download new 
functionality from remote servers. A rogue plug-in can act as a perfect Trojan 
horse. It can look innocent enough and provide useful function while spawning 
threads in the background with full access to the local file system and the 
Internet (if connected). Beware of installing features from update sites you do 
not trust.</p>
<p>By using Update Manager, we can connect to the update site and examine its 
content (we will talk more about this later in the article). Once we find 
features we want to install, we can bring up the install wizard and let it 
complete the installation.</p>
<p>After we restart Eclipse, features and their corresponding plug-ins will be 
physically present in our product location. Features and plug-ins will not be 
archives any more: they will now be <b>installed</b>. All the features will be 
in the 'features' directory, and all the plug-ins in the 'plugins' 
directory.</p>
<p>Of course, Eclipse is never empty to begin with. Every Eclipse product starts 
its life with a number of plug-ins and features. They were not installed using 
Update Manager - they were placed there as a baseline content. Initial update 
operations will be performed using this baseline as a reference.</p>
<h3>Checking for updates</h3>
<p>The easiest way to use Eclipse Update starting from a fresh Eclipse 
installation is to see if there are new versions of currently installed features 
available. Features typically have a URL to the site where updates can be found. 
When <b>Help&gt;Software Updates&gt;New Updates</b> is selected, Eclipse will 
connect to these update sites and try to find new versions of the already 
installed features. If found, they will be presented in the installation wizard. 
After accepting the license agreements, pressing <b>Finish</b> and completing 
the installation, your Eclipse product will have the latest updates.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this operation is performed by Eclipse product 
customers - people that bought the product and want to have the latest service 
update of it. If you are the product provider, it is your responsibility to 
build the features and place them on the update site for your customers to find. 
In the following sections, we will learn how.</p>
<h2>Time to get our hands dirty</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the basics of the Eclipse Update mechanism, it is time 
to see it in action. We will use the 'Hello, World' plug-in, create a feature 
for it, publish it on an update site and then install it into another Eclipse. 
Since plug-in development is not the focus of this article, we will take 
advantage of PDE to do it fast.</p>
<p><img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tip.gif" height="13" width="62"> The goal of our example is 
to use one Eclipse product as a development environment, and publish a feature 
that can be installed into another Eclipse product. In order to keep things 
clean, we suggest you install two copies of Eclipse in your file system - one to 
use for development, and another to act as a product. Download the 2.1.1 version 
of Eclipse SDK from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse.org</a> 
and unzip it into the two different locations.</p>
<h3>Creating a feature</h3>
<p>We will start by making the plug-in project by selecting 
<b>New&gt;Project&gt;Plug-in Development&gt;Plug-in Project</b>. We will choose 
'com.example.xyz' for the project name (this will become our plug-in ID as 
well). We will accept the defaults and select 'Hello, World' template from the 
<b>Plug-in Code Generators</b> page.</p>
<p>After pressing <b>Finish</b>, we should have the plug-in project created and 
visible in the Package Explorer. Newly created manifest file will be opened for 
editing in the PDE manifest editor. We should take this opportunity to test our 
new plug-in by following the 'Run...' hyperlink from the <b>Welcome</b> editor 
page. The test Eclipse instance that will appear should contain a tool bar 
button that will greet us with a 'Hello, World' message box when pressed. Our 
goal is to get our plug-in packaged, published and installed into another 
Eclipse so that we can see the same message box there.</p>
<p>Before we move on to creating a feature, we must perform one important step: 
make sure all the files we need will end up in the packaged plug-in. An 
important file controls how plug-ins and features are built: build.properties. 
It has been created by PDE wizard automatically, but it may not contain all the 
things we need. In our particular case, 'Hello, World' wizard created 
<b>'</b>icons<b>'</b> directory that we need to include in the <font size="2">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tag_1.gif" align="middle" height="13" width="24"> </font>bin.includes 
variable as follows:</p><font size="2">
<blockquote><pre>bin.includes = 	plugin.xml,\<br>		xyz.jar,\<br>	    <img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tag_1.gif" align="middle" height="13" width="24">	icons/<br>source.xyz.jar = src/</pre></blockquote></font>
<p>Once we have the plug-in, know that it is working and ready to build, we will 
create a feature. To do so, select <b>New&gt;Project&gt;Plug-in 
Development&gt;Feature Project</b>. We will use the same ID as for the plug-in 
but change the project name to avoid name collision in the workspace. We will 
choose 'com.example.xyz-feature'. After pressing <b>Next</b>, we will be able to 
change the ID into 'com.example.xyz', name into 'XYZ Feature' and provider into 
'XYZ Inc'. Pressing <b>Next</b> again will take us to the page where we can pick 
plug-ins and fragments that should belong to the feature. We will select the 
only plug-in available (com.example.xyz). At this point we can press 
<b>Finish</b> to get our project created.</p>
<p>The wizard operation is analogous to the one for plug-in projects in that it 
creates the project and the necessary files, and opens the feature manifest for 
editing. The manifest editor is the usual PDE variety which means that you don't 
need to know the exact XML DTD to be productive - you can use form pages 
exclusively.</p>
<p>Feature manifests can get complex in some cases, but we don't need to use all 
their capabilities for our little exercise. Our goal is to define the 
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature id, version, name and provider (<b>Overview</b> page - already set 
  by the wizard) 
  </li><li>Short description, license agreement, copyright notice (<b>Information</b> 
  page) 
  </li><li>Plug-ins and fragments that belong to the feature (<b>Content</b> page - 
  already set by the wizard) </li></ul>
<p><img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tryit.gif" height="13" width="61"> Switch to the Information 
page and<br></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ul>
  <li>select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feature Description</span> 
  section and enter the following text: </li></ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This feature is 
designed to allow us to make XYZ plug-in available for installation using 
Eclipse Update Manager.</span> </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ul>

  and enter the following text: </li></ul>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ul>
  <li>select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">License Agreement</span> 
  section and enter the following text: </li></ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">License Agreement<br><br>You 
must accept this license agreement in order to install this<br>feature into your 
product.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
  <img title="" alt="Feature Description" src="keeping-up-to-date_files/license.jpg" height="327" width="546"><br><br><b>Figure 3:</b> Setting 
the Licence Agreement</div></div>
<p>Now save the file, switch to the <b>Overview</b> page and select 
<b>Preview</b> from the pop-up menu. This handy function taps into Eclipse 
Update API to test if the feature we are creating will be liked by Update 
Manager when packaged and deployed. If everything is fine, you should see the 
<b>Preview</b> (part of the Update Manager) open, showing you the feature 
properties. You should be able to see the description, follow the 'License' and 
'Copyright' hyperlinks and see the correct name, provider and version (and above 
all, this demonstrates that the manifest file is loaded without errors by the 
Update XML parser):</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/feature-preview.jpg" border="0" height="470" width="511"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 4:</b> Preview of the feature as it is being designed 
in the workspace.</p>Note that the actual size and location of the view will 
depend on the perspective in which it was opened. We made the view in Figure 4 
taller to allow you to see it without the scroll bars. In most perspectives it 
opens stacked with the other views in the lower-right corner.<br>
<h3>Creating an update site</h3>
<p>Having created a plug-in and a feature, we need to build them and make them 
available on an Eclipse <b>update site</b>. The update site concept is very 
powerful and flexible, but requires some advanced programming in order to tap 
into that power. For this reason, Eclipse provides a default implementation of 
the required interfaces that makes feature publishing easier and 
programming-free.</p>
<p>We said earlier that in order to build a site, we need a <b>site map</b> 
(site.xml). In addition, we need to package features and plug-ins into JARs and 
place them alongside the map in the 'features' and 'plugins' directories, 
respectively. By placing these files and folders on an HTTP server connected to 
the Internet, you are making the site visible to Eclipse users around the 
world.</p>
<p>There are many ways to build an update site. Large products with automated 
builds can package features and plug-ins, upload them onto the server and update 
site.xml automatically. For smaller projects and for experimentation, PDE 
provides tooling for update site creation. It will come in handy for our example 
as well.</p>
<p><a name="siteLocation"></a>We will start by creating an update site project by 
selecting <b>New&gt;Project&gt;Plug-in Development&gt;Update Site Project</b>. 
We will pick 'update-site' for a project name, but choose a non-default location 
for the project for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If your local machine is also a server or you have file system access to 
  the server (e.g. shared drives), you can create the site project directly in 
  the server root. Changes made to the server project resources will be 
  instantly visible to everybody. 
  </li><li>Even if it isn't, by locating the update site outside of a workspace, you 
  can share the site between several workspaces. This is important if you want 
  to build <b>multiple versions</b> of features and plug-ins and place them in 
  the same site (which is often the case). You must do it this way because when 
  you are self-hosting in Eclipse, you can only work on one version of each 
  plug-in at a time per workspace. </li></ol>
<p>Very predictably, the wizard creates a new site project, site map and opens 
the file for editing in the usual PDE multi-page editor. </p>
<p align="left">The first step is to connect the features in the workspace and our 
site. The update site manifest editor is actually a combination of an editor and 
a builder in that it keeps track of features in the workspace, builds them and 
packages them in a format required by the Update Manager. The packaged files are 
then placed directly into the site project in the required folders. To connect 
features and the site, we need to switch to the <b>Build</b> page and press 
<b>Add...</b> in <b>Features To Build</b> section. The wizard should contain 
'com.example.xyz' feature (version 1.0.0) that is in our workspace. When we 
choose it and press <b>Finish</b>, this feature project is now added to the 
build map of this site.</p>
<p align="left">Adding a feature project to the build map will not make it visible 
to people that connect to our site. It is possible to have features in the 
update site that are not visible. For example, if you build a complex feature 
that includes several smaller ones, you only need to make the root visible in 
the site. When users select your complex feature for installation, all the 
children will be recursively downloaded as part of the process.</p>
<p align="left">To make our XYZ feature visible, we need to select the checkbox in 
the above mentioned section. You will notice that an entry appeared in the 
<b>Outline</b> under <b>Features</b>. Indeed, if you switch to <b>Features</b> 
page, you will see this entry in the list. What this means is that the feature 
will be visible to users who connect to our site and browse it. Note how the 
feature archive name is a combination of the feature ID and version. This way 
you can place many different versions of the same feature side by side:</p>
<p align="center">
<img title="" alt="Features on update site" src="keeping-up-to-date_files/feature-refs.jpg" height="399" width="581"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5</b>: Defining the features that will be visible when 
connecting to the site.</p>
<p align="left">Our site description is now ready to be built. To do so, we will 
switch to the <b>Build</b> page and press the <b>Build</b> button. After the 
build operation has finished, you should have a JAR in both the 'features' and 
'plugins' directory. Check that you have the following content in your Navigator 
or Package Explorer after the build operation. Note that Navigator shows all the 
resources, so you will also see a folder where build information is kept 
(.sitebuild). This folder is used by the site builder only and is hidden for a 
reason. It is used at development time only and plays no role in a published 
site.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/explorer.jpg" border="0" height="192" width="235"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6</b>: Package Explorer view after building the update 
site.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tip.gif" align="left" height="13" width="62"></p>
<p align="left">You have probably noticed that there are two buttons in the 
<b>Build</b> page: <b>Build</b> and <b>Rebuild All</b>. Why two? The later is 
easy to understand: it unconditionally builds all the plug-ins and features in 
the build map. In contrast, the former builds only features and plug-ins that 
changed since the last build. Building features may take time if they reference 
many plug-ins, so it definitely makes life easier. However, it is not as 
fine-grain as incremental builders that run on resource changes, since the 
expectation is that you will not need them as often.</p>
<h3 align="left">Testing the site</h3>
<p align="left">We can test our site without leaving the workspace. Update Manager 
treats local and remote sites equally (the only exception being that remote 
sites have an extra download step before you can access its files). We can use 
this property to go to our site and verify that we can browse it correctly. If 
we can, so will our users once we publish it on the server.</p>
<p align="left">All you need to do is open Update Manager (<b>Help&gt;Software 
Updates&gt;Update Manager</b>), locate icon <b>My Computer</b> in Feature 
Updates and drill down into the location on the file system where our 
'update-site' project folder is. You will notice that it is actually not 
represented as a folder in the view. Instead, it shows a pink diamond icon (<img title="" alt="site" src="keeping-up-to-date_files/site_obj.gif" height="16" width="16">) used for 
update sites. This is a good sign - it means that the view recognized that this 
folder is in fact an update site and immediately switched into site browsing 
mode. You can browse the site right there, but a better way is to bookmark it 
(select it and choose <b>Bookmark Location...</b> from the pop-up menu). This 
will bookmark the site so that you don't have to drill down in the future.</p>
<p align="left">If everything is OK, you should see <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other</span> (the default category) with one feature 
in it: XYZ Feature 1.0.0. When you select it, the feature properties should show 
up in the <b>Preview</b>.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tip.gif" height="13" width="62"> When creating 
more complex sites, you would first create a <b>category definition</b> to help 
people accessing your site see features classified into logical groups. That 
way, categorized features will not appear under the Other folder, but under 
their category folder.</p>
<p align="left">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tip.gif" height="13" width="62"> As you are 
testing your site over and over, remember to select <b>Refresh</b> from the 
pop-up menu before making conclusions. Update Manager tries to be as efficient 
as possible so it will not react to changes in the file system unless you force 
it to drop the cached data and connect to the site anew.</p>
<h3 align="left">Implanting the update URL</h3>
<p align="left">There is one extra task we need to perform before publishing the 
site. It represents our investment in the future. Although our users can use 
Update Manager to navigate to the update site, find the new version and install 
it, it requires more knowledge and work than is really necessary. By implanting 
a URL that points at the update site, Eclipse can search for new updates 
automatically, with minimal user intervention.</p>
<p align="left">Embedding a URL that points to the site with updates is easy, but 
you need to select the URL wisely. Once you ship the feature, the server must be 
located where you said it will be. You can change this URL in the subsequent 
versions of your feature, but do spend some time thinking about it - if you do, 
you will not need to change it often. For example, Eclipse.org update site is <a href="http://update.eclipse.org/updates/">http://update.eclipse.org/updates/</a> 
and is unchanged since release 2.0.</p>
<p align="left">Since in our example the site is local on the file system, we will 
use file protocol for the update URL. All we need is to add the update URL to 
our feature.xml:</p>
<div align="left">
<p align="left">
<img title="" alt="" src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tryit_002.gif" height="13" width="61"> 
<br>On the <b>Overview</b> page of the feature manifest editor locate the 
<b>Feature URLs</b> section. Choose <b>New&gt;Update URL</b> from the pop-up 
menu and edit the object properties in the property sheet when created. /p&gt; 
</p><p align="left">

<h3 align="left">Publishing the site to a server</h3>
<p align="left">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tip.gif" height="13" width="62"> This step is not 
needed if you are directly updating a site on the local file system or on a 
local server, as it was discussed when <a href="#siteLocation">creating 
the update site project</a>.</p>
<p align="left">You can publish the site in many ways. If you do not have access 
to a server, the simplest way to publish it is to export the site project into a 
local directory, outside the Eclipse workspace. </p>
<p align="left">A more powerful way to publish the site to a remote server is by 
using the optional <b>Eclipse FTP and WebDAV Support</b> feature available as a 
separate download from Eclipse.org. You can create a target for your update site 
project on the server, and upload deltas using FTP or WebDAV protocols whenever 
you rebuild the site. If your server is not enabled for FTP or WebDAV, then 
you'll have to manually deploy the site to the server. In this example we assume 
that your server is FTP-ready.</p>
<p align="left">First, let's use the Update Manager to download the FTP and WebDAV 
Support: switch to the Update Manager, add a bookmark to <a href="http://update.eclipse.org/updates/">http://update.eclipse.org/updates/</a>, 
expand it, expand <b>Eclipse SDK 2.1.0</b> category and find <b>Eclipse FTP and 
WebDAV Support</b>. Select the feature and press <b>Install Now</b> button in 
the <b>Preview</b>. It will download, install and configure this feature 
automatically. Restart when asked and that's it.</p>
<p align="left">Now that our Eclipse workbench can act as an FTP client, we can 
prepare the site for publishing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the update site project and bring up the pop-up menu. 
  </li><li>Choose '<span style="font-weight: bold;">Team-&gt;Target Site</span>'. The 
  wizard will open. 
  </li><li>Select '<span style="font-weight: bold;">FTP</span>' protocol and press 
  'Next'. 
  </li><li>Select the FTP URL that includes the remote server and the path from the 
  FTP root to the physical root of the site as defined by the HTTP server. 
  </li><li>Specify user name and password for the FTP account. Press Next. 
  </li><li>Specify the directory that will be the project root on the server (use the 
  provided default that is the same as the project name). 
  </li><li>Press 'Finish'. </li></ol>
<p>You have now established the target site. Changes you make in the workspace 
will be compared to the target and delta will be computed when upload is 
needed.</p>
<p>To upload, select the project and use 'Team-&gt;Synchronize with target' 
option. This will bring the familiar 'Synchronize' view used with CVS 
repositories. Select the desired branch or the root and 'Upload' the content to 
the server.</p>
<h3 align="left">The geek test</h3>
<p align="left">Let's now pretend that our feature is published and that we were 
told that there is this cool XYZ feature that is a 'must have'. To pretend 
successfully, we need to install another copy of Eclipse 2.1.1 SDK in a 
different location (to act as a product) and launch it. When it comes up, 
immediately switch to the Update Manager and create a bookmark in Feature 
Updates. If the site was published locally, drill down to the site location 
using <b>My Computer</b> and create a bookmark for it. If the site was published 
on a remote server, then create a Site bookmark to the appropriate site URL.</p>
<p align="left">You should be able to expand this bookmark and see the same things 
as before when we tested the site. This time, we will go all the way and press 
the <b>Install Now</b> button. You should accept our fake license, accept the 
default location and press <b>Finish</b>. After restarting Eclipse, our XYZ 
Feature (and XYZ Plug-in) will be installed.</p>
<p align="left">How to tell that everything went well? Check any of the 
following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Switch to the <b>Resource</b> perspective and select <b>Window&gt;Reset 
  Perspective</b> (this is required because perspective was created and 
  persisted before we installed our plug-in, so we must reset it to see our 
  contribution). A new tool bar button should show up, as well as <b>Sample 
  Menu</b> with a <b>Sample Action</b> in the menu bar. Both the button and the 
  action should open the 'Hello, World' message box, indicating that our plug-in 
  is alive and well. 
  </li><li>Select <b>Help&gt;About&gt;Feature Details</b>. Our feature should be on 
  the list. 
  </li><li>Switch to Update Manager and expand <b>Eclipse Platform</b> node in 
  <b>Install Configuration</b>. Expand the install location object. It should 
  show 'XYZ Feature 1.0.0'. </li></ol>
<h2>Providing feature updates</h2>
<p>As it usually happens, after you successfully deploy the 1.0.0 version, it is 
likely you will need to provide bug fixes to your customers.</p>
<p>One very important thing to remember is that once you publish your plug-ins 
and features, any changes to their code must cause version increments. After you 
change one line of your code, it starts to differ from what people have 
installed on their machines, which means it is not the same version. In Eclipse, 
this is handled by creating a maintenance branch in the repository. This branch 
is used for fixes of the shipped code base while further development goes on 
unimpeded in the main development stream.</p>
<h3>Creating an update</h3>
<p>Since we found a bug, we will create a <b>bug fix release</b>. We started 
with version 1.0.0, so we will make 1.0.1 this time (increment only service 
portion of the version). We need to make a number of changes to the existing 
plug-in and feature, so make sure the 1.0.0 versions are saved somewhere.</p>We 
will start by editing plugin.xml of our plug-in project and incrementing its 
version to 1.0.1. In addition, we will modify 
com.example.xyz.actions.SampleAction.java file to show a different text in the 
message box: 
<blockquote><pre>  <font color="#7f0055" size="2"><b>public</b></font><font size="2"> </font><font color="#7f0055" size="2"><b>void</b></font><font size="2"> run(IAction action) {<br>     MessageDialog.openInformation(<br>          window.getShell(),<br>          </font><font color="#2a00ff" size="2">"Xyz Plug-in"</font><font size="2">,<br>          </font><font color="#2a00ff" size="2">"Hello, UPDATED Eclipse world"</font><font size="2">);<br>  }</font></pre></blockquote>
<p>This will take care of the plug-in. Next, we will handle the feature. First, 
open feature.xml again. Since we changed plug-in version, we must repair the 
broken reference in the feature: on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Content 
</span>page remove the com.example.xyz plug-in and add it back (PDE will 
automatically handle this in a future Eclipse release). In addition, we must 
increment the feature version on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview 
</span>page to 1.0.1, because Update compares feature versions when scanning for 
new updates. Finally, we will change the description of the feature to say 
something about the fix; add this text to the Feature Description section: <span style="font-style: italic;">This version contains a fix to a critical bug found 
during writing of this article</span>.</p>
<h3>Building and publishing the update</h3>
<p>Now that we updated the feature, we must rebuild everything and 
republish.</p>
<p>We will start by opening site.xml using the site map editor. When you switch 
to the <b>Build</b> page, note how the icon for the 'XYZ Feature 1.0.0' is gray 
and hollowed out. This indicates that we contain a reference to this feature but 
cannot find it in the workspace. This is OK - since this is shared project, 
there will always be features that we cannot find (because they are in other 
workspaces). We need to add our modified XYZ Feature 1.0.1 to this list and 
check the checkbox. This will add another feature entry to the site 
manifest.</p>
<p>When we switch to the <b>Features</b> page, we can indeed see this entry. 
Repeating what we did before, we will select this entry and add it to our 
category. After saving the file, we can select <b>Build</b> from the pop-up menu 
(no need to switch back to the <b>Build</b> page). If everything went well, you 
should now have TWO plug-ins in the 'plugins' folder and TWO features in the 
'features' folder.</p>
<p>As before, we can preview the site using Update Manager (this is where 
bookmarking the site is paying off). You should now see two features (XYZ 
Feature 1.0.0 and 1.0.1) and switching between them should show differences in 
the description.</p>
<h3>The geek test, updated</h3>
<p>Finally, the fix is ready. This is where our decision to implant a URL that 
points at our update site is paying off. All the users need to do is select 
<b>Help&gt;Software Updates&gt;New Updates</b> and wait for the results.</p>
<p><img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tryit_002.gif" height="13" width="61"> So far, our 'pretend' 
Eclipse product has 'XYZ Feature 1.0.0' installed. When we select this command, 
a progress monitor will show up, searching for new updates. It is shortly 
replaced with a wizard showing the results of the search:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="keeping-up-to-date_files/one-click2.jpg" border="0" height="500" width="600"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 9:</b> Result of the update search.</p>
<p>What happened? Eclipse checked currently installed features, connected to the 
update sites using URLs in feature manifests, and searched for features with the 
same ID but higher version. Since our site had a feature that matched this 
description, it showed up in the wizard. We can now proceed with the 
installation and the result will be the same as if we installed it from the 
Update Manager, only with fewer mouse clicks.</p>
<p>When you publish your features, you definitely want your users to follow this 
path because it is the most straightforward way of bringing the updates in.</p>
<p>
<img title="" alt="" src="keeping-up-to-date_files/tip.gif" height="13" width="62"> After 
installing a new feature or updating an existing feature it is possible to go 
back to a previous configuration state. Do this from the Configuration History 
node in the Install Configuration view.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope this article makes you think twice about sending more 'just unzip 
...' notes with attachments. Instead, your next note should read:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
  <p>A new tool named XYZ Feature is now available for download from update 
  site<br>http://xyz.example.com/updates/</p></blockquote>
<p>Each subsequent note should simply be:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><span style="font-style: italic;">Version 1.0.1 of XYZ Feature is now available for 
download from update site</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
http://xyz.example.com/updates/ </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; You can 
install it directly by selecting the New Updates 
action.</span><b><br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>More can be 
done with Eclipse update. You can make a more complex feature by <span style="font-weight: bold;">including </span>several smaller ones, with some of 
them <span style="font-weight: bold;">optional</span>. By providing <span style="font-weight: bold;">patches</span>, you can update branches of the complex 
feature hierarchy, not just the root feature. You can also create a 
<b>branding</b> plug-in and associate it with a feature to make your feature 
stand out in a number of places in the workbench. If your feature is <span style="font-weight: bold;">primary</span>, that plug-in can also contain a splash 
screen that replaces the default Eclipse splash. Finally, you can package a set 
of features and plug-ins that represent a significant function and add it to 
other Eclipse products during installation using <b>linked extensions</b>.</p>
<p>Our example only scratched the surface of update capabilities. As your code 
grows in complexity, so will your software update needs.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Update Manager Developer Tips</h2>
<p><b>By Alexandre Junqueira, INMETRICS</b> <br>
  <font size="-1">January 13, 2004</font> </p>
<p>This appendix presents some real-world tips to avoid common mistakes during 
  the creation and maintenance of Eclipse update sites. Creating an update-site 
  is easy, but you need to adhere to some unwritten rules to get a well-functioning 
  artifact.</p>
<h3>Tip #1: Always remember trailing slash "/"</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One major pitfall when build Update 
sites is that everything goes well until the final test. But then, even the most 
simplistic site <b>doesn't work</b> in Update Manager (or Install/Update dialog 
-- for those using Eclipse 3.0). </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then comes the "bit-brushing" work of 
trying to get everything work by hand, since the "update site" is no more than a 
bunch of XML and JAR files you've created with assistance of Eclipse wizards ...
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">first, you try to check the HTTP 
  access to the update site, and it works; 
  </p></li><li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">then, you check file permissions to 
  certifies that anyone can read them; they're also ok; 
  </p></li><li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">come back to the Eclipse workbench 
  and, surprisingly, it <b>doesn't work at all</b>; 
</p></li></ol>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You check, double-check, and even 
triple-check the above steps, and then you give up on creating an update site 
and deliver your brand new plug-in as a downloadable .zip file to the community, 
so at least it could be <b>manually</b> installed. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This situation is common place for 
you? If so, then you've probably ran in one of the most tricky behaviors of the 
update manager. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The problem is: <b>you must put a 
trailing slash ("/") in the update site URL defined in "feature.xml" XML file.</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Go back to the Feature Editor (if 
you're using Eclipse 3.x), or open "feature.xml" file you've created. Look for 
the <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> tag. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This tag contains the reference to 
the site where Update Manager will look for your plug-ins installation files. 
BUT THIS URL MUST BE TERMINATED BY A SLASH CHARACTER. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why such behavior? Because Eclipse's 
Update Manager appends plug-in distribution file name to the URL you've set up 
there, <b>without</b> pre-pending with "/" ... so, instead of getting something 
like </p>
<pre>"http://your.site/update/plugin_1.0.0.jar"</pre>
<p>it gets </p>
<pre>"http://your.site/updateplugin_1.0.0.jar"</pre>
<p>which explains why, after all, Eclipse doesn't find your master piece. It's 
looking for an inexistent URL!</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Fill the blanks</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another common pitfall when build 
features to publish in update sites is to avoid writing copyright and license 
notices. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's specially true when building 
your update site for the first time (you don't want to write a major legal act 
-- you're just trying to make your work available, no?). </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Eclipse's Update Manager will 
look for such disclaimers and doesn't allow you to install features that don't 
provide such notices. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, to avoid such pain in the 
uttermost stage of deploying, write down at least a simple word in both fields.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The recommended way is to use a 
template-based text for both fields, such as: </p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>copyright</b> </dt>
  <dd>Copyright (c) 2004 by John Doe. All rights reserved </dd>
  <dt><b>legal</b> </dt>
  <dd>This work follows CPL/GPL/LGPL/BSD licensing schema. See
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Update/update-tips/%3Clicense-site%3E">&lt;license-site&gt;</a> for more details 
  about usage and distribution. </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Tip #3: Be careful when using <i>build.xml</i></h3>
<p style="word-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If you're the 
developer of the plug-in been published, then you've almost certainly created 
the <b>build.xml</b> using the "Create build file" (or "Create ant build file") 
pop-up menu option on plugin.xml. </p>
<p style="word-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If you did so, and 
specially, you've customized the file, then BE CAREFUL. </p>
<p style="word-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before creating and 
building an update site project, create a backup of your <b>build.xml</b> file. 
The update-site project build option will <b>erase</b> every <i>build.xml</i> it 
finds in the features and plugins required by the site -- which leads to lost 
work. </p>
<p style="word-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To avoid this 
problem, create another ant build-file to hold your customization and use it 
instead of default the "build.xml".</p>
