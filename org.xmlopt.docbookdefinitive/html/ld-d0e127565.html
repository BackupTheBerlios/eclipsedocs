<p>The bird on the cover of <em class="citetitle">DocBook: The Definitive Guide</em> is a wood duck. Often considered one of the most beautiful ducks in North America, the mail wood duck has a metallic purple and green head with white streaks extending from its bill around the eyes and down to its blue and green, gold-flecked wings. It has a white neck, chestnut-colored chest, a white or red bill, and yellow-orange legs and feet. Females have more brown, gray, and subdueed hues.</p>
<p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a 19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover layout was produced by Kathleen Wilson using QuarkXPress 3.32 and Adobe's ITC Garamond font. The inside layout was designed by Alicia Cech, based on a series design by Nancy Priest. The text was formatted from SGML into FrameMaker 5.5 with Jade, using a DSSSL conversion stylesheet written by Chris Maden. The interior fonts are ITC Garamond Light, Garamond Book, and
ConstantWillison.</p>
